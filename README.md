# Paw2Door - An aggregator for Pet Rescues 
  The goal of this project was to create an aggregator for pet rescues to make it easier for people to adopt a pet.  
  This project was done as part of the Makers Academy final engineering project.

## User Stories

## Technologies 
This application was built using a tech stack of:
 - SQLite
 - Django
 - Django REST Framework
 - ReactJS (Reactstrap)
We chose these technologies because we needed to create a full stack application.  
Django was chosen because the team wanted to learn a new coding language in python and we found Django to one of the more popular backend solutions with SQlite support being packaged with Django. 
React was chosen because we wanted a JS frontend which allowed for asynchronou functions so that our application could be a dynamic SPA.
